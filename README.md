# Sample Ruby Code for Authorize.Net
This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Ruby integration with the Authorize.Net Ruby SDK (https://www.github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-ruby).

The samples are organized into categories and common usage examples, just like our API Reference (http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference). Our API Reference is an interactive guide to the Authorize.Net API, which gives explanations for request and response parameters and has embedded code windows to allow you to send actual requests right in the API Reference.


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained so you can look at them to get a gist of how the method works, you can use the snippets to try in your own sample project, or you can run each sample from the command line.

## Running the Samples From The Command Line
Clone this repository.  
Run the individual samples e.g.   
```
    $ ruby PaymentTransactions/charge-credit-card.rb 
```
