# Sample Ruby Code for Authorize.Net
This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Ruby integration with the [Authorize.Net Ruby SDK](https://www.github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-ruby).
The samples are organized just like our API, which you can also try out directly here: http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained so you can look at them to get a gist of how the method works, you can use the snippets to try in your own sample project, or you can run each sample from the command line.

## Running the Samples From The Command Line
Clone this repository.  
Run the individual samples e.g.   
````
    $ ruby PaymentTransactions/charge-credit-card.rb 
````
