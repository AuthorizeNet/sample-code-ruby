# Sample Ruby Code for Authorize.Net
This repository contains working code samples which demonstrate Ruby integration with the Authorize.Net Ruby SDK (https://www.github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-ruby).

The samples are organized into categories and common usage examples, just like our API Reference Guide (http://developer.authorize.net/api/reference). Our API Reference Guide is an interactive reference for the Authorize.Net API. It explains the request and response parameters for each API method and has embedded code windows to allow you to send actual requests right within the API Reference Guide.


## Using the Sample Code

The samples are all completely independent and self-contained so you can look at them to get a gist of how the method works, you can use the snippets to try in your own sample project, or you can run each sample from the command line.

## Running the Samples From The Command Line
1. Install the [Authorize.Net Ruby SDK](https://www.github.com/AuthorizeNet/sdk-ruby).
2. Clone this repository:
```
    $ git clone https://github.com/AuthorizeNet/sample-code-ruby
```

3. Run the individual samples. For example:  
```
    $ ruby PaymentTransactions/charge-credit-card.rb 
```
